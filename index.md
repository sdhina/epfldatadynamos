If you’ve ever dived into a wikipedia article, only to emerge 5 articles later with 10 facts unrelated to your search, you know that the digital labyrinth is full of gems and dead-ends. Your initial quest to understand the history of pizza might take you three articles down to the Spanish Wars of Succession as you learn about the House of Savoy and Princess Margarita, the eponym to the three ingredient classic. 

At times navigating wikipedia is a skillful hunt for the right fact, at others it’s a random stroll, gathering and picking the most insightful information. You might be of those who strategically dives through hyperlinks to a specific target seeking for a unique embedded fact, or you might aimlessly skim until a striking concept or unknown word changes your trajectory.
